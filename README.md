# Complete-Operators-Code
ANYONE MAY USE MY CODE FOR WHATEVER THEY WANT

this is just some code to help me determine how a boolean operator can be incomplete
it's mainly to help me understand the possible outputs that an incomplete boolean operator results in.
Hopefully that can help me with a proof I am attempting for a Math course I am taking.
the code isn't particularly well optimized and its not super understandable (not really much documentation),
but if you get some use out of it, then have at it.

Have a good one!
